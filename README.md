# README

To develop an overbooking appointment scheduling approach that incorporates machine learning-enabled individual no-show predictions, while quantifying potential cohort bias effects in service fairness:
• To predict individual no-show probabilities utilizing a machine learning framework and administrative data available from AMA.
• To design an appointment scheduling methodology that considers individual no-show probabilities.
• To evaluate the performance of the methodology using operational metrics and group-based fairness indicators.
